# üå≥ Binary Trees: A Foundation in C

## üåü Project Overview

This project is dedicated to the study and implementation of **binary trees**, a fundamental data structure in computer science. Through a series of practical tasks, you will learn how to create, manipulate, traverse, and analyze binary trees from the ground up in C. This will provide you with a solid understanding of how these hierarchical structures operate and their importance in algorithms and data storage.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to master the following concepts:

### General Concepts
* The core structure and components of a binary tree node.
* The differences between various tree traversal methods: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.
* How to determine key properties of a tree, such as its height, depth, and size.
* The specific conditions that define special types of trees, including leaves, roots, full trees, and perfect trees.
* How to find relationships between nodes, like siblings and uncles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

### General
* **Editors:** You are permitted to use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.
* **Compilation:** All your files must be compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `gcc`, with the following options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
* **File Formatting:** All files must end with a new line character.
* **README:** A `README.md` file is **mandatory** and must be located at the root of the project directory.
* **Coding Style:** Your code must adhere to the **Betty style**. It will be checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
* **Global Variables:** The use of global variables is **strictly forbidden**.
* **Function Limit:** You may not have more than 5 functions per file.
* **Standard Library:** The use of the standard C library is allowed.
* **Header File:** The prototypes for all your functions must be included in the header file named `binary_trees.h`.
* **Header Push:** You must push your `binary_trees.h` file to your repository.
* **Include Guards:** All your header files must be protected by include guards.
